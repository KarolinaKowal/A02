## Part 2: Glossary 
**Branch**: A repository contains branches, and can be helpful when trying to make changes without disrupting the main or primary branch. Changes made in the branch can later be merged back with the main or primary branch. 
</br>
**Clone**: It is a local copy of a repository. Files can be edited on another editor and be uploaded to Git without being online. The repository that has been cloned is connected to the remote version online, so whenever you are online, you are able to push the local changes you have made to the remote version online.
</br>
**Commit**: To make changes to a file or a set of files. When a commit is made, your work is saved, and Github will generate a unique ID (aka the "SHA" or the hash) to keep a record of the saved changes. It will also keep a record of who made those changes and when they made those changes. Commits have a brief description that displays what changes were made. 
</br>
**Fetch**: When changes are being added from the remote repository to a local copy without committing those changes. 
</br>
**GIT**: It is an open source program that tracks changes made in text files. It was written by the author of the Linix operating system, and serves as the foundation of Github.
</br>
**Github**: It is an open source version control system that allows collaborator(s) to track their changes by uploading their source code here. They can also collaborate with other people and revert to a previous version if bugs are introduced. 
</br>
**Merge**: It takes the changes from one branch and applies it to another branch. A merge can be done via a "pull request" or via the command line.
</br>
**Merge Conflict**: When branches are merged, conflicts may happen. For instance, if people are making changes to the same line, or if one person tries to edit the file while another person deletes the file.
</br>
**Push**: To update the remote repository with committed changes you have made locally. You can "push" these changes onto the remote repository after changing them locally, and that will allow others to access it. 
</br>
**Pull**: The ability to fetch changes and merge them. For example, you can "pull" in the changes made to the remote repository, and update your local copy with them.
</br>
**Remote**: The version of a repository or branch that is hosted on another server, such as on Github.com. As changes are made, the repository/branch on Github is updated to display the changes. 
</br>
**Repository**: It is considered to be the most basic element of Github. It can be thought of as a project's folder, and includes all of the project's files. It also includes each file's revision history. Repositories can be public or private and can include one or more collaborators.
